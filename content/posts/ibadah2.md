### Ibadah

```
In Arabic ibadah is connected with related words such as "Ubudiyyah" ("slavery"), and has connotations of obedience, submission, and humility. The word linguistically means "obedience with submission".[3]

In Islam, ibadah is usually translated as "worship" and means obedience, submission, and devotion to God.[4][1]

Other sources (noted Islamist author Abul A'la Maududi[5] and others)[6] give a broader definition of ibadah, including keeping speech free "from filth, falsehood, malice, abuse", and dishonesty, obeying Islamic Shariah law in "commercial and economic affairs" and in "dealings with your parents, relatives, friends", and everyone else.[5]
